Backtest trading strategies with Python.

Kudos to Zach Lûster for the original project [`kernc/backtesting.py`](https://github.com/kernc/backtesting.py) which 
he built and maintained for 5 years. 

We at [LUCIT](https://www.lucit.tech) like to use `backtesting.py` with our customers in smaller projects. 
Unfortunately the project is missing important updates and therefore we decided to fork the project and release new 
stable versions. 

We are happy to maintain the forked repository and take care of code reviews, pull requests and releases and hope for 
good support from the community!

Installation
------------

    $ pip install lucit-backtesting


Usage
-----
```python
from lucit_backtesting import Backtest, Strategy
from lucit_backtesting.lib import crossover

from lucit_backtesting.test import SMA, GOOG


class SmaCross(Strategy):
    def init(self):
        price = self.data.Close
        self.ma1 = self.I(SMA, price, 10)
        self.ma2 = self.I(SMA, price, 20)

    def next(self):
        if crossover(self.ma1, self.ma2):
            self.buy()
        elif crossover(self.ma2, self.ma1):
            self.sell()


bt = Backtest(GOOG, SmaCross, commission=.002,
              exclusive_orders=True)
stats = bt.run()
bt.plot()
```
